== Injection into tests

So far we have only covered integration style tests that test the app via HTTP endpoints, but what if we want to do unit testing and test our beans directly?

Quarkus supports this by allowing you to inject CDI beans into your tests via the `@Inject` annotation (in fact, tests in Quarkus are full CDI beans, so you can use all CDI functionality). Let's create a simple test that tests the greeting service directly without using HTTP.

Create a new test class file in `src/test` in the `org.acme.people` package called `GreetingServiceTest.java`. Use the following code for the file's contents (note we've included the proper imports for you):

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import org.acme.people.service.GreetingService;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;

@QuarkusTest
public class GreetingServiceTest {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger("GreetingServiceTest");

    @Inject // <1>
    GreetingService service;

    @Test
    public void testGreetingService() {
        Assertions.assertTrue(service.greeting("Quarkus").startsWith("hello Quarkus"));
    }
}
----
<1> Here we are injecting our `GreetingService` and calling it, just as our RESTful resource endpoint does in the production code.

You will see new test along with your existing tests run instantly in the terminal once again. Verify the tests are passing.

[NOTE]
====
As mentioned above Quarkus tests are actually full CDI beans, and as such you can apply CDI interceptors as you would normally. As an example, if you want a test method to run within the context of a transaction you can simply apply the `@Transactional` annotation to the method and the transaction interceptor will handle it.

In addition to this you can also create your own test stereotypes. Stereotypes can be particularly useful in large applications where you have a number of beans that perform similar functions, as it allows you to do something akin to multiple inheritance (multiple annotations) without having to repeat yourself over and over.

For example we could create a `@TransactionalQuarkusTest` if we needed to write a large number of tests that required transactional support with particular configuration. It would look like (do not copy this code anywhere!)

[source, java]
----
@QuarkusTest
@Stereotype
@Transactional
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
public @interface TransactionalQuarkusTest {
}
----

If we then apply this annotation to a test class it will act as if we had applied both the `@QuarkusTest` and `@Transactional` annotations, e.g.:

[source, java]
----
@TransactionalQuarkusTest
public class TestStereotypeTestCase {

    @Inject
    UserTransaction userTransaction;

    @Test
    public void testUserTransaction() throws Exception {
        Assertions.assertEquals(Status.STATUS_ACTIVE, userTransaction.getStatus());
    }

}

== Mock support

Quarkus supports the use of mock objects using the CDI `@Alternative` mechanism. To use this simply override the bean you wish to mock with a class in the `src/test/java` directory, and put the `@Alternative` and `@Priority(1)` annotations on the bean. Alternatively, a convenient `io.quarkus.test.Mock` stereotype annotation could be used. This built-in stereotype declares `@Alternative`, `@Priority(1)` and `@Dependent`.

Let's mock our existing `GreetingService`. Although our existing service is pretty simple, in the real world the service might have too many dependencies on external systems to be feasible to call directly.

Create a new class file in `src/test/java` in the `org.acme.people` package called `MockGreetingService.java` with the following code:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package org.acme.people;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.acme.people.service.GreetingService;
import io.quarkus.test.Mock;

@Mock
@ApplicationScoped
public class MockGreetingService extends GreetingService {

    @Override
    public String greeting(String name) {
        return "hello " + name + " <<<<<<<<<< from mock greeting >>>>>>>>>>";
    }
}
----

Now modify our existing `GreetingServiceTest` class to add a log statement showing the value retrieved during the test. Modify the `testGreetingService` method to look like:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Test
    public void testGreetingService() {
        LOGGER.info("greeting: " + service.greeting("Quarkus"));
        Assertions.assertTrue(service.greeting("Quarkus").startsWith("hello Quarkus"));
    }
----

The test results of the mock will be updated automatically in the terminal:

[source, none]
----
All 4 tests are passing (0 skipped), 1 test was run in 556ms. Tests completed at 01:37:50 due to changes to MockGreetingService.class and 1 other files.
----

Press `o` to toggle test output and press `r` to re-run the continuous testing. Then, you will see:

[source, none]
----
INFO  [GreetingServiceTest] (Test runner thread) greeting: hello Quarkus <<<<<<<<<< from mock greeting >>>>>>>>>>
----

This confirms that our `MockGreetingService` is being used instead of the original `GreetingService`.

Make sure to press `p` to pause the continuous testing before you go to the next lab:

[source, none]
----
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [:] for the terminal, [h] for more options>
----

== Congratulations!

In this section we covered basic testing of Quarkus Apps using the `@QuarkusTest` and supporting annotations. This is an important part of any software engineering project and with Quarkus, testing has never been easier. For more information on testing with Quarkus, be sure to review the https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing[Quarkus Testing Guide^].

In the next section we'll talk about how to effectively debug Quarkus applications. On with the show!
